title:  C++ is not dead, it just smells funny
tags:
---

I thought that would be a quite strong title for a first post (well, sans the
obligatory introductory one).


Disclaimer: C++ will get some serious (and in my opinion, well deserved)
bashing here. So if you *really* love C++ and get easily upset by people
expressing negative emotions towards your favourite programming language,
better stop reading now. On the other hand, if you are a discontent C++ user
wondering if there are any better alternatives out there, you might get some
useful info out of this article (I hope so!). Just to make this crystal clear (because
I know this is a sensitive topic for many): when I'm stating that C++ is
a horrible language, I *do not* think that *people* who like (or have to use)
C++ are idiots, nor that *software* written in C++ is crap---not even that
Bjarne Stroustrup is stupid! All my criticism is geared towards C++, the
programming language.
