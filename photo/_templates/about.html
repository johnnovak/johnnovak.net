      <p>Australian photographer Naomi Mawson is quickly developing a reputation for creative and emotive portraiture that captures the very essence of her subjects.</p>

      <p>Naomi is inspired by the challenge of capturing hersubjects individual personalities. She uses natural light, and incorporates rich textures and interesting structures into her backgrounds. This combined with her rapport with her subjects, especially children, results in inspiring  examples of Australian photographic portraiture. </p>

      <p>2009 sees Naomi Mawson moving into a new creative realm in publishing the 2010 Mother Nature Australia Collection. The inspiration for the collection was the sanctity of Mother Nature, the gift of life and our oneness with our environment. The collection focuses on the life-giving and nurturing features of nature by symbolising it in the form of the mother caring for her newborn.</p>
